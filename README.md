Problem this app solves: Boredom it's a game!

This project is a Blackjack game using Node.js, express
and mySQL. It is also using Handlebars as a template to display the HTML page.
This project will be deployed on Heroku.

Players will be able to play blackjack on multiple devices at once. Players will place bets against the dealer, choose to hit or stay and possibly split bets.

We may send funny tweets as a result of winning or losing to the dealer.
